| [Automatic SpeechRecognition Pipeline](./automatic_speech_recognition.md) |                           Pipeline that aims at extracting spoken text contained within some audio.                           |
| [Document Question Answering Pipeline](./document_question_answering.md)  | This pipeline takes an image (and optional OCR'd words/boxes) as input and works similar to the Question Answering Pipeline;. |
|                   [Fill Mask Pipeline](./fill_mask.md)                    |                                         Masked language modeling prediction pipeline.                                         |
|          [Question Answering Pipeline](./question_answering.md)           |                                                 Question Answering pipeline.                                                  |
|        [Text2Text Generation Pipeline](./text2text_generation.md)         |                                  Pipeline for text to text generation using seq2seq models.                                   |
|         [Text Classification Pipeline](./text_classification.md)          |                                               Pipeline for text classification.                                               |
|             [Text Generation Pipeline](./text_generation.md)              |         Pipeline for language generation. This pipeline predicts the words that will follow a specified text prompt.          |
|     [ZeroShot Classification Pipeline](./zero_shot_classification.md)     |                                       Pipeline for NLI-based zero-shot classification.                                        |
